     <strong>The costs of running an electric car</strong>
  <p>If you’re thinking of driving an electric car, the upfront or monthly leasing cost can be higher than an equivalent petrol or diesel model. However, in most other regards an electric vehicle (EV) will be cheaper to run, which potentially adds up to large savings over time.</p>

  <p>The electric motors, batteries and transmission of electric vehicles have many fewer moving parts than those of a petrol or diesel car, and this means you can save money, as they are cheaper to maintain and repair.

EV batteries also have long warranties – usually eight years – which tends to be more than the warranty for the car itself. 

Despite their relative simplicity versus a combustion car, EVs do still need regular servicing, though. As they are heavier, tyres and suspension parts may wear out more quickly.</p>
  <p>Is the cost of running an EV lower?
