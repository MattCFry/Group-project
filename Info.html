     <strong>The costs of running an electric car</strong>
  <p>If you’re thinking of driving an electric car, the upfront or monthly leasing cost can be higher than an equivalent petrol or diesel model. However, in most other regards an electric vehicle (EV) will be cheaper to run, which potentially adds up to large savings over time.</p>

  <p>The electric motors, batteries and transmission of electric vehicles have many fewer moving parts than those of a petrol or diesel car, and this means you can save money, as they are cheaper to maintain and repair.

EV batteries also have long warranties – usually eight years – which tends to be more than the warranty for the car itself. 

Despite their relative simplicity versus a combustion car, EVs do still need regular servicing, though. As they are heavier, tyres and suspension parts may wear out more quickly.</p>

        When comparing the Tesla Model Y vs. Volkswagen ID.4, you might notice that Tesla's touchscreen is bigger, but this
        doesn't necessarily mean that it is better.
        
        
        
        For example, both vehicles allow you to control the temperature of your car. Although, many consumers have found the
        physical buttons in the new VW ID.4 for sale to be easier to use than the Tesla Model Y's tech-centered interface.
